* Find the medians of the list of numbers
  * O(n<sup>2</sup>): Use a list to keep track of the sum of medians by getting the middle element
* 2SUM Problem: Compute the number of target values t in the interval [-10000,10000] such that there are distinct numbers x,y   in the input file that satisfy x+y=t.
  * Sort the numbers and scan from both sides of the array for such numbers
